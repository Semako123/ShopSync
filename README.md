# Design Document: E-commerce Product Comparison Application
## 1. Introduction
The e-commerce product comparison application aims to provide users with a platform to compare products across multiple e-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, Jiji, Jumia, etc. Users can input a product link from any supported platform, and the application will retrieve similar products from other platforms, allowing users to make informed purchasing decisions.

## 2. Architecture Overview
The application follows a client-server architecture, with the frontend providing a user interface for input and display, and the backend handling data extraction, similarity analysis, API integration, and response generation.

### 2.1 Frontend
* Technology: JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS
* Responsibilities
- Capture user input (product link).
- Display results, including the list of similar products and their details.
- User authentication and authorization (if applicable).
### 2.2 Backend
* Technology: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL
* Responsibilities:
- Receive and validate user input (product link).
- Extract product data using web scraping techniques (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy).
- Analyze product similarity using NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) and machine learning algorithms (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).
- Integrate with APIs provided by other platforms to search for and retrieve similar products.
- Aggregate and structure the retrieved data into a response format.
- Handle error cases and provide appropriate error messages.
- Implement user authentication and authorization (if applicable).
## 3. Backend API Endpoints
### 3.1 POST /api/products/compare
- Description: Submits a product link for comparison and retrieves a list of similar products.
- Request Body:
- product_link (string): The link to the product on the source platform.
- Response:
  ` 200 OK: Returns a JSON response containing the list of similar products with their details.`
  ` 400 Bad Request: Returns an error message if the product link is invalid or missing.`
## 4. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
### 4.1 Users
Table Name: users
Columns:
id (primary key): Unique identifier for each user.
username: User's username.
password: User's hashed password.
created_at: Timestamp indicating user creation.
### 4.2 SimilarProducts
Table Name: similar_products
Columns:
id (primary key): Unique identifier for each similar product.
source_platform: Platform from which the product link is submitted.
source_product_id: Identifier of the product on the source platform.
target_platform: Platform where the similar product is found.
target_product_id: Identifier of the similar product on the target platform.
similarity_score: Numeric value indicating the similarity between the products.
created_at: Timestamp indicating when the similar product entry is created.
## 5. Security Considerations
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data and ensure secure access to the application.
Use appropriate hashing algorithms to securely store and verify user passwords.
Sanitize user input and implement proper validation to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
## 6. Deployment and Scaling
Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
Utilize containerization with Docker for easier deployment and scaling.
Employ load balancing and autoscaling to handle increased traffic and ensure high availability.
## 7. Future Enhancements
Implement user-specific features like saved searches, personalized recommendations, or user preferences.
Integrate additional e-commerce platforms to expand the supported platforms.
Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce API calls to external platforms.
